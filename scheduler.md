It seems like you're trying to run Flask alongside the APScheduler, which is causing some issues with starting the Flask server.

The problem lies in the fact that both Flask's development server (app.run()) and APScheduler's blocking scheduler (scheduler.start()) are running in the main thread, which can cause conflicts.

To resolve this, you should consider running Flask and APScheduler in separate threads or processes. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:

python
Copy code
from flask import Flask, request, redirect, session, render_template_string
from apscheduler.schedulers.background import BlockingScheduler
import threading

app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = 'your_secret_key'

def authenticate(password):
    # This is a simple authentication function, you should implement a more secure one in practice
    return password == 'your_password'

def bot_logic():
    if not session.get('authenticated'):
        return redirect('/')
    # Your bot logic here
    print("Bot logic executed")

@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def index():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        password = request.form.get('password')
        if authenticate(password):
            session['authenticated'] = True
            return redirect('/bot')
        else:
            return render_template_string('<h1>Incorrect password</h1>')
    return render_template_string('''
        <form method="post">
            <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Enter password">
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
    ''')

@app.route('/bot')
def bot():
    bot_logic()  # Call the bot logic function
    return '<h1>Bot route accessed</h1>'

def start_flask():
    app.run(debug=True)

def start_scheduler():
    scheduler = BlockingScheduler()
    scheduler.add_job(bot_logic, 'cron', day_of_week='*', hour='*', minute='*', timezone='Asia/Kolkata')
    scheduler.start()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    flask_thread = threading.Thread(target=start_flask)
    flask_thread.start()

    scheduler_thread = threading.Thread(target=start_scheduler)
    scheduler_thread.start()
In this modified version, Flask and APScheduler are started in separate threads (flask_thread and scheduler_thread), allowing both to run concurrently without interfering with each other. This should resolve the issue you were experiencing with the Flask server not starting.






It looks like there's an issue with your code organization. You're attempting to start the Flask app before defining the routes and the scheduler. In Python, you typically define functions and classes before executing any code that depends on them.

Here's the corrected version of your code where the Flask app is started after defining all the necessary components:

python
Copy code
from apscheduler.schedulers.background import BackgroundScheduler
from flask import Flask, request, redirect, session, render_template_string

app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = 'your_secret_key'

def authenticate(password):
    # This is a simple authentication function, you should implement a more secure one in practice
    return password == 'your_password'

def bot_logic():
    # df1m = rDfKline1m()
    # df30m = rDfKline30m()
    print("Bot logic executed")

@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def index():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        password = request.form.get('password')
        if authenticate(password):
            session['authenticated'] = True
            return redirect('/bot')
        else:
            return render_template_string('<h1>Incorrect password</h1>')
    return render_template_string('''
        <form method="post">
            <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Enter password">
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
    ''')

@app.route('/bot')
def bot():
    if not session.get('authenticated'):
        return redirect('/')
    # Your bot logic here
    bot_logic()
    return '<h1>Bot route accessed</h1>'

if __name__ == "__main__":
    sched = BackgroundScheduler(daemon=True)
    sched.add_job(bot_logic, 'cron', day_of_week='*', hour='*', minute='*', timezone='Asia/Kolkata')
    sched.start()
    app.run()
Now, the Flask app will start after defining the routes and the scheduler, ensuring everything works as expected.









The primary difference between using BackgroundScheduler and BlockingScheduler from apscheduler.schedulers.background and apscheduler.schedulers.blocking, respectively, lies in how they manage the execution of scheduled jobs.

BackgroundScheduler: This scheduler runs in the background of your application. It does not block the execution of the main thread, allowing your Flask application to continue running while scheduled jobs execute independently in the background. It's suitable for scenarios where you want scheduled tasks to run without interfering with the main application flow.

BlockingScheduler: In contrast, this scheduler operates synchronously and blocks the execution of the main thread until the scheduled jobs are completed. It's suitable for standalone applications or scenarios where you want to ensure that all scheduled tasks are completed before proceeding with further execution.

In the provided code:

python
Copy code
sched = BackgroundScheduler(daemon=True)
Here, BackgroundScheduler is used, indicating that scheduled tasks (bot_logic in this case) will run independently in the background while the Flask server continues to handle incoming requests.

If you were to use BlockingScheduler, you would define the scheduler as follows:

python
Copy code
from apscheduler.schedulers.blocking import BlockingScheduler

scheduler = BlockingScheduler()
Then, you would add your job to this scheduler and start it. However, with BlockingScheduler, you need to make sure that starting the scheduler doesn't block the execution of your Flask application or any other critical processes.

In most cases, for integrating with a Flask application, BackgroundScheduler is preferable as it allows your application to remain responsive while executing scheduled tasks.
